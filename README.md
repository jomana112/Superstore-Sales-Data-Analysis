Superstore Sales Data Analysis
# 🛍️ Superstore Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes sales and performance data from a fictional superstore. The goal is to uncover insights about profit, sales trends, product categories, customer segments, and regional performance to help improve business decisions.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore how profit and sales vary by region, category, and sub-category.
- Identify top-performing and underperforming areas and products.
- Understand customer behavior by segment and shipping method.
- Visualize patterns over time using plots and dashboards.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Certain categories (e.g., Technology) have high sales but may not always yield high profit.
- Some regions (like the South) had high order volumes but low average profit.
- The **Standard Class** shipping method was the most commonly used.
- **Discounts** significantly impact profitability — higher discounts often lead to negative profits.
- Segmenting customers helped detect trends in spending and profitability.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly` for data visualization

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a sample Superstore sales data including columns like:

- Order Date, Region, Category, Sub-Category
- Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity
- Customer Segment, Shipping Mode

## 🧠 Next Steps

The analysis can be extended to:

- Forecast future sales or profits using time series models.
- Build a recommendation system for most profitable product bundles.
- Predict customer churn or segment behavior using classification models.
